The RTK Kanji list is ordered to build up from a foundation but
that order is not frequency of usage or how important the Kanji is.

That may be a bit annoying.

RTK does not teach any Japanese readings - only conceptual meanings
and only associated with English words in order to create a mapping
of english word to Kanji _in that direction_!

The Kanji is taught in school to kids who quite naturally already
speak and understand the language, see those kanji symbols every day,
are free to ask anyone any questions about them, etc. etc.

There's a fixed order of learning. The learning is by repetition.
